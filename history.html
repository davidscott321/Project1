          Foods similar to pizza have been made since the neolithic age. Records of people adding other ingredients to bread to
          make it more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history. In the 6th century BC, the Persian soldiers of
          Achaemenid Empire during the rule King Darius I baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle shields
          and the ancient Greeks supplemented their bread with oils, herbs, and cheese. An early reference to a pizza-like food
          occurs in the Aeneid, when Celaeno, queen of the Harpies, foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they
          are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal that includes
          round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that these are the
          "tables" prophesied by Celaeno.

          Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples in the 18th or early 19th century. Prior to that time,
          flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, cheese, and basil. It is uncertain when
          tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims. Until about 1830, pizza was sold from open-air stands
          and out of pizza bakeries, and pizzerias keep this old tradition alive today.

          A popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza Margherita, was invented in 1889, when the Royal
          Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor
          of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pizza
          swathed in the colors of the Italian flag: red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind
          of pizza was then named after the Queen, although recent research casts doubt on this legend. An official letter of
          recognition from the Queen's "head of service" remains on display in Esposito's shop, now called the Pizzeria Brandi.

          Pizza was brought to the United States with Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth century and first appeared in
          areas where Italian immigrants concentrated. The country's first pizzeria, Lombardi's, opened in 1905. Following World
          War II, veterans returning from the Italian Campaign after being introduced to Italy's native cuisine proved a ready
          market for pizza in particular. Since then pizza consumption has exploded in the U.S. Pizza chains such as Domino's,
          Pizza Hut, and Papa John's, pizzas from take and bake pizzerias, and chilled or frozen pizzas from supermarkets make
          pizza readily available nationwide. 13% of the US population consumes pizza on any given day.
